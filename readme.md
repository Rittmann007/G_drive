# G_drive 🚀  
A minimal Google Drive clone — my first backend project!

## 📌 About
**G_drive** is a lightweight file storage web app inspired by Google Drive. Built using Node.js and Express, it allows users to upload, view, and manage files in a simple and intuitive interface.

This project marks my first step into backend development, where I explored:
- Express routing and middleware
- MongoDB for storing file metadata
- Appwrite for handling file storage
- EJS for rendering dynamic views

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, EJS
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Storage**: Appwrite Bucket

## 🚧 Status
Currently deployed on Render:

- forgot to add login(/users/login) register(/users/register) buttons 🥲🥲

## 📚 Learning Goals
- Understand RESTful API design
- Integrate cloud storage with backend logic
- Handle user authentication and file access securely
- Deploy full-stack apps on free hosting platforms

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
Thanks to open-source communities and docs that helped me navigate backend development for the first time.
